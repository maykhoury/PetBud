# PETBUD
PetBud is an Android application designed to support the mental well-being of children living with diabetes. It uses a gamified approach to make medication management more engaging and less stressful for children.

## Motivation
Diabetes management in children can be challenging and stressful. It's crucial to empower children to manage their condition, but the process can often feel daunting. PetBud aims to change this by gamifying the process. By caring for a virtual pet with diabetes, children can learn about their own condition in a fun and engaging way.

## Core Features
* **Virtual Pet**: Children care for a virtual pet that also has diabetes, mirroring their own condition.
* **Medication Management**: Parents input their child's medication details, and the child cares for the virtual pet by administering the same medication routine.
* **Parental Monitoring**: Parents can monitor the health of the virtual pet, which reflects their child's adherence to their medication routine.

## Complementary Features
* **Rewards System**: Children earn rewards for properly caring for their virtual pet, encouraging positive behavior.
* **Notifications**: Parents receive notifications about the virtual pet's health, keeping them informed.
* **Connection Through Care**: PetBud provides a platform for parents to connect with their child through the care of the virtual pet.
